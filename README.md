# MyLilCountdownProject
Basically, I am beginning to dev in javascript. I wanted to do base javascript and not use libarys to create things using pre-defined code. So, I decided to make this countdown clock. Pretty basic, but for a starter by myself I though it's not that bad.
## Features:
* Clock that incraments every second, by itself.
* Gif's for times: Evening is past 7, but after 10. Morning is before 10 and after 5, and evening is between 7 and 5. If it hits the else, then it will give an error gif.
* Button to change the time from analog to digital, and vice versa.
* Responsive presentation.
### Summary
This is just a little project I did in a day, nothing big obviously. Thought I would share it here for anyone to comment on or give me tips on how to make it more efficient.
